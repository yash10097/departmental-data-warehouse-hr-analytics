# Run Analytics - Create Dashboards

## Introduction

In this lab, you will use a DVA file to run analytics in Oracle Analytics Cloud.

## Objectives

As a system administrator or application developer:

- Create connection to ADW  
- Upload DVA files and refresh connection + data
- View analytics

## Required Artifacts

- Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) instances.
- Access to the files needed to recreate this demo. 
    - [AttritionPrediction.csv](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/fp-wLXQ7mf0Q5Dtae0hH9o1VABJujAfRI2UOVs4dzsU/n/oradbclouducm/b/bucket-20200907-1650/o/AttritionPrediction.csv)
    - [HumanResources.dva](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/0VqpqURMs3ARIovzyCfR369sv5qqvVxMkmGbag8-wWA/n/oradbclouducm/b/bucket-20200907-1650/o/HumanResource.dva)

Note: Please download the files above before continuing.

### STEP 1: Installing HR Schema on Autonomous Database

- Use SQL Developer to connect to your already provisioned database with the ADMIN user. The steps to do so can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/connect-sql-dev182.html#GUID-14217939-3E8F-4782-BFF2-021199A908FD).

- Run the following code to create the HR user.

    ![](./images/1.png " ")

- Now go ahead and log in as the HR user, then run the following [scripts](https://github.com/oracle/db-sample-schemas/tree/master/human_resources) to create the HR schema. Run the hr_main.sql script.

- A pair of optional scripts, hr_dn_c.sql and hr_dn_d.sql, is provided as a schema extension. To prepare schema HR for use with the directory capabilities of Oracle Internet Directory, run the hr_dn_c.sql script. If you want to return to the initial setup of schema HR, use script hr_dn_d.sql to undo the effects of script hr_dn_c.sql.
For a complete listing of the scripts and their functions, refer to [this](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/COMSC/scripts.htm#COMSC00020).

**Note:** You can use script hr_popul.sql to populate the tables and hr_drop.sql to drop schema HR.

- The following tables will have been installed: EMPLOYEES, LOCATIONS, JOBS, COUNTRIES, DEPARTMENTS, REGIONS, JOB_HISTORY

- On sql developer, click on any of the tables, and click on *Model*, you should see the table relationships.

### STEP 2: Setting up the Human Resource Analytics Project in OAC

- Login to your analytics cloud instance. This can be done from the page of the instance.

    ![](./images/2a.png " ")

- On the far right hamburger menu, select **Import Project/Flow**

    ![](./images/3.png " ")
    ![](./images/4.png " ")

-  Import the Human Resources.dva file into OAC. The password is **Admin123**. Read more [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/bi/analytics-desktop/bidvd/import-application-or-project.html).

    ![](./images/5.png " ")
    ![](./images/6.png " ")

- Go to **Data** -> **Connections** and you should see a connection named 'adw_hr'. 

    ![](./images/7.png " ")

- Click on the ellipses menu on the extreme right of the connectionâ€™s name and select inspect.

- Click on the **Select** button in front of Client Credentials and select the wallet to your ADW instance. Let the username be **ADMIN** and provide the database password. Click **Save**.

    ![](./images/8.png " ")

- We will now refresh our data sets to utilize our connection. Move to the hamburger menu and select **Data**-> **Data Sets**, you will see all our tables appear below. Go ahead and reload the data.

    ![](./images/9.png " ")

- Now, proceed to the hamburger menu and select **Catalog** and open your project. The visualizations should load, but click **Refresh Data** if needed to refresh the visuals.

### STEP 3: Uploading a file to the Datawarehouse using OAC

- Return to the home page. Click on the **Create** button and then select **Data Flow**.

    ![](./images/11.png " ")

- Select the **Create Data Set**, choose the **Click to Browse** option and select the AttritionPrediction.csv file. 

    ![](./images/12.png " ")
    ![](./images/13.png " ")

**Note:** You may drag and drop the file instead.

- Once the file is uploaded, select **Add**.
    ![](./images/14.png " ")

- Next, drag the **Save Data Set** option from the **Data Flow Steps** on the left to the panel at the top right next to the Attrition Prediction data set. Provide a name for the Data Set. In the **Save Data To** drop down, select **Database Connection**. 

    ![](./images/15.png " ")

- Click on **select connection** and choose the adw_hr connection. Thereafter, also give a name that would be used for the table in the database.

    ![](./images/16.png " ")

- Hit the **Run Data Flow** button. You will be prompted to save the data flow. Give it a name and click on **Save & Run**.

    ![](./images/17.png " ")
The data flow should run and upon successful execution you should be able to see the two data sets under the **Data** menu item.

    ![](./images/18.png " ")

### STEP 4: Using Attrition Data set in the Human Resource project

- Open the Human Resource project. From the data panel, click on the 'plus' sign and select **Add Data Set**.

    ![](./images/19.png " ")

- Select the **AttritionPrediction** data set that is stored in the database.    
    
    ![](./images/20.png " ")

- Click on the '+' sign next to the canvas names at the bottom of the screen to add a new canvas. 

    ![](./images/21.png " ")

- Right click on the name of the new canvas and choose **Rename**. Give the canvas a meaning full name.

    ![](./images/22.png " ")

- Now drag the **Employee Count** data item under Attrtion Prediction to this canvas to get you first visualisation. 

    ![](./images/23.png " ")

We will now leave it upto your imagination to analyse the data sets that have been provided to you.
